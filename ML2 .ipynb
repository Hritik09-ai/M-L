    "# Overfitting:\n",
    "# A. Definition: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and fluctuations in the\n",
    "# data rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize\n",
    "# to new, unseen data.\n",
    "# B. Consequences: The overfitted model is too complex and essentially memorizes the training set, making it sensitive to\n",
    "# small variations that might be present in the training data but are not representative of the overall pattern.\n",
    "# C. Mitigation:\n",
    "# * Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, which penalize overly complex models\n",
    "# by adding a regularization term to the loss function.\n",
    "# * Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple subsets of the\n",
